“I/We have done this assignment completely on our own. I/We have not copied it, nor
have I/we given my solution to anyone else. I/We understand that if we are involved in
plagiarism or cheating we will have to sign an official form that we have cheated and that
this form will be stored in my official university record. I/we also understand that I/we
will receive a grade of 0 for the involved assignment and my/our grade will be reduced
by one level (e.g., from A to B) for my/our offense, and that I/we will receive a grade of
“F” for the course in the case of egregious examples or any additional offense of any
kind.”
